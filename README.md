# Sending Money Using Python — Web3.py tutorial

_Trigger warning: The following tutorial contains elements of explicit cryptography, peer-to-peer financial services and other transgressive behaviors. The examples are meant only to illustrate the power and ease of blockchain for Python._

Hey all yall Pythoners out there!

I’m really into the Python community. Like so many, Python was my first programming language. The Python hackathon and meet-ups are awesome. And, as a bonus point, [I love Monty Python!](https://pythonspamclub.com/monty-python-and-programming-language/)

I thought I’d join all these loves together with my current job: showing developers how powerful blockchain programming can be, and how easy the skills are to pick up.

This will be a tutorial walking Python developers through the basics of Web3.py, a blockchain (Ethereum) library. We’ll do a lot of this from the Python interpreter. (In the next tutorial, we’ll setup a proper directory but we’re keeping things easy for now!)

_*Note: For security reasons, we’ll be sending our money over a test network. All of these same techniques can be used on the main Ethereum network.*_
